This project implements a simple task management system with the following features:

1. Add new tasks
2. View existing tasks
3. Mark tasks as completed
4. Save tasks to a file for persistence

To practice with this project:

1. Copy the code into a new Python file (e.g., `task_manager.py`).
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. Interact with the program by choosing options from the menu.
4. Add some tasks, view them, and mark them as completed.
5. Exit the program and run it again to see if the tasks are persisted.

As you work with this project, try to understand how each function works and how they interact with each other. You can also extend the project by adding new features, such as:

- Deleting tasks
- Editing task descriptions
- Adding due dates to tasks
- Filtering tasks by status (completed/pending)
- Sorting tasks by creation date or due date
